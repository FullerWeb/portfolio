      <h2>Design Philosophy: Minimalism</h2>

      <p>
        Minimalistic web design is a design philosophy that focuses on simplicity, clarity, and functionality. It
        emphasizes
        removing unnecessary elements and distractions to create a clean and streamlined user interface. In minimalist
        design,
        less is more; every element serves a purpose and contributes to the overall user experience.
